// 1.) I think that it will spit out the first line three times (due to line 14) and then once it
// hits three it will print out the 2nd line.

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		for( int i = 1; i <= 3; i++ )

// 4.) I actually thought that I was wrong because of the simplicity of the code that had me 
// thinking there had to be more to it!
